            <p class="about_upper_info_paragraph">has been providing the highest quality Japanese green tea for over three centuries. <br>
                More than just a retailer, Matcha Verde is a multi-faceted tea company that carefully selects, blends, and crafts its tea.
                <br>
                Our teas are of the finest class, cultivated in the mountains of Kyoto and the surrounding area. This region is renowned for producing the highest grade of green tea in Japan, thanks largely to its mild misty climate, mineral-rich soil, and near-perfect balance of sunshine and rainfall.</p>
