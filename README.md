A matcha drink is in my daily routine, is my coffee. That gave me the motivation to build a project that has to do with Matcha. I'm building a website with my own touch. Implementing HTML, CSS, JS and now with PYTHON, FLASK and MYSQL. I'm learning a lot of things but most importantly I'm learning how to solve problems that I haven't encounter before. It's fun, stressing and gives me a lot of headaches but when I overcome every obstacle it feels AWESOME.
